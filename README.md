# Dynamic Supply Chain Intelligence Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard designed for real-time, data-driven supply chain monitoring and decision-making. This dashboard leverages diverse operational, environmental, and logistics metrics to provide actionable insights, optimize efficiency, and mitigate risks across the supply chain.

Key Features & Metrics:

- Real-Time Vehicle & Route Monitoring

    - vehicle_gps_latitude, vehicle_gps_longitude – track fleet location.

    - eta_variation_hours – monitor delivery schedule deviations.

    - traffic_congestion_level, route_risk_level – evaluate travel conditions and risks.

- Fuel & Operational Efficiency

    - fuel_consumption_rate – track fuel efficiency.

    - loading_unloading_time, handling_equipment_availability – assess warehouse operations.

    - driver_behavior_score, fatigue_monitoring_score – ensure safe driving practices.

- Inventory & Order Management

    - warehouse_inventory_level – monitor stock levels.

    - order_fulfillment_status, historical_demand – optimize inventory planning.

    - lead_time_days, customs_clearance_time – track supply chain throughput.

- Supply Chain Risk & Cost Analysis

    - shipping_costs, supplier_reliability_score – manage supplier and shipping performance.

    - weather_condition_severity, port_congestion_level, cargo_condition_status – identify potential disruptions.

    - disruption_likelihood_score, delay_probability, risk_classification – quantify risk exposure.

    - delivery_time_deviation – monitor service level adherence.

- IoT & Environmental Monitoring

    - iot_temperature – monitor cargo conditions during transit.

Purpose:

This dashboard empowers supply chain managers to:

- Predict and mitigate delays

- Optimize routes and inventory

- Improve supplier reliability and operational efficiency

- Enhance safety and compliance monitoring

Built with Power BI, it provides interactive visualizations, alerts, and analytics to support proactive, data-driven decision-making in complex logistics networks.
